# Bootstrap `full` smart package for Meteor

This particular package pulls in all sub-packages from the [Bootstrap smart-package collection](http://github.com/matb33/meteor-bootstrap). This package is a good starting point in using Bootstrap with Meteor. Should you wish to only include specific components of Bootstrap, you can remove this package and add only the packages you need. The necessary dependant packages will be pulled in automatically.

## Usage:

`meteor add matb33:bootstrap-full`
